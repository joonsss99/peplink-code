Version 0.17
    * Allow setting the process credentials to things other than root

Version 0.16
    * Sending an ALRM signal to the fakeroot-ng process dumps to the log all
      tracked processes, along with their state
    * Add -f option - flush log after every print
    * Greater support for platforms that have no automatic new process attach
      mechanisms. Will now detect children through the clone return code.
    * Improve the ptrace emulation layer - will now attach fake debugger to
      child correctly.
    * Fix to the PTRACE_DETACH emulation - would not restart the process from
      which we detached.

Version 0.15
    * mkdirat would not put the directory into the lie database
    * When running chmod and when creating files and directories - do not
      allow the user to actually remove the permission for user - emulates the
      root behavior of allowing access to a file regardless of its actual
      permission.
    * Fix bug - when importing existing file's permission into the lie database,
      we used to copy the file's real uid into the fake gid.

Version 0.14
    * Fix bug in unlinkat - context data used in incorrect order, resulting in
      "Not a directory" error when deleting a file.
    * Remove configure command line to get format string protection to dlog
    * Solve all dlog format string warnings
    * Fix bug in distclean - would not remomve generated template makfile from
      arch/linux directory
    * The -p option will now connect to an existing debugger, if one exists.
    * Allow use of FAKEROOT_TMPDIR as well as TMPDIR for setting the location
      of the temporary files
    * Allow changing the default shared mem directory from /tmp via a
      configure command option (--with-memdir)

Version 0.13
    * Remove libtool from the ptlib build system. Make the actual build
      faster. Suggested by Bernhard R. Link
    * Add checks to make sure that fakeroot-ng will warn of a temporary
      directory that is mounted with "noexec"
    * Running "fakeroot-ng" with no arguments will run the current shell as
      "root"

Version 0.12
    * Complete the chroot support for all *at functions

Version 0.11
    * Fix compilation error
    * Resolve uninitialized buffer reliance for fork and vfork

Version 0.10
    * Implement set_string for copying a string into process space
    * Prevent the debugged process from sending a signal to the debugger
    * Chroot support (all but the *at functions)

Version 0.09
    * Read and writes to process memory can now be performed in any length
      and/or alignment
    * As a result - recursive debugger now works for x86_64 (only for 64bit)

Version 0.08
    * Many many many code cleanups
    * New platform (partially) supported - Linux/x86_64:
      * Supported - basic running
      * Not supported (well) - recursive debuggers, 32 bit programs
    * Really fix the "openat" issue this time
    * Add a program "calc_defaults" that attempts to detect values for a new
      platform's platform_specific.h
    * Write a new platform porting HOWTO

Version 0.07
    * Fix compilation errors on platforms that don't or partially support
      "openat"

Version 0.06
    * Fix bug with mknod implementation - would save state too late
    * Fix incorrect use of hyphen as minus in the man page
    * Add support for fchownat, fchmodat, mknodat, openat, mkdirat, symlinkat

Version 0.05
    * Add recursive debugger support - mainly strace at the moment

Version 0.04
    * Add a PowerPC port

Version 0.03
    * Add storing persistent state between runs
    * Several bug fixes

Version 0.02
    * New functions supported: chown, getgid/getegid, mknod (creating device
      files)
    * Assume ownership to root when creating files, directories and symbolic
      links
    * Improve some "stat" handling semantics
    * Slight change to the command line parameters
    * Internal restructuring and code cleanup
    * Entire emulation of all basic operations (a few know bugs for fringe
      cases).

Version 0.01
    * Initial release. Supports Linux/i386 only. Only supports {,f,l}stat64,
      (f)chmod and get(e)uid.
